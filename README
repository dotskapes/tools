These tools are part of the dotSkapes Project. They are designed to run on the skapes research platform at http://www.skapes.org

All tools are written in Python and R. Those with user interaction use a custom user_param for web interactivity. Most have user in the file name. To run then stand-alone, either:
1) turn user_param into a function
2) remove references to user_param variables in the body and replace with constants or define new variables.

The aggregate function depends on our SaVaGelib library on launchpad.
